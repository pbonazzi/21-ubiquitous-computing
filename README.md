# Contributions

This project was done solely by me, because I have registered for the class one week after teams were formed...

# Projects Reports
The first project did not required any report, whereas the second needed one (p2/Report.pdf). 

# Solutions .ipynb files

### Navigation
The folder P1 corresponds to the first practical, P2 to the second.
Each folder itself contains the solution in pyth file, the data used for the solution is privated and cannot be shared under ETH law.
