# Welcome to ubiquitous computing

In the first exercise, I extract information from a series of sensors about a person’s physical
state. In the second exercise, I use sensor values to learn more about a person’s internal state.

## 1. Reproducibility

Follow these instructions to set up a local repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/pbonazzi/21-ubiquitous-computing.git
jupyter notebook
```

## 2. Reference

Only the emotion classification project required a report.
